There are two players, black and white. To gain points and win you have to hit as many Colored AI balls as possible. If you hit your own color ball nothing happens, but if you hit another players AI ball you get points and that AI ball get removed from the game. If two AI player balls collide both players get points and both balls disappear. Balls spawn in every .5 seconds. Each Colored AI ball is worth a certain amount of points.
